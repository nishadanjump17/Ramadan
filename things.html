        <p>During Ramadan, all Muslims must offer Salat, which implies offering prayers five times a day. Salat is one of the Five
        Pillars of Islam and helps Muslims to seek Allah’s forgiveness and guidance. These prayers are known as Salat al-fajr,
        Salat al-zuhr, Salat al-‘asr, Salat al-maghrib and Salat al-‘isha. Muslims should perform Dhikr meaning appreciating
        Allah through their prayers. Muslims should pray for the health and prosperity of their family.</p>
